    "## Introduction\n",
    "Perfumes are a part of our everyday lives‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a subtle floral hint or a bold, spicy statement, most people have a signature scent that others come to recognize them by. But have you ever wondered what‚Äôs actually in your favorite fragrance? Perfumes are complex mixtures of countless molecules, and each one plays a unique role in shaping the scent you love.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how can you figure out which molecule is responsible for that special note in your perfume? And once you have a molecule in mind, how do you know if it‚Äôs safe, aromatic, or even used in other fragrances?\n",
    "\n",
    "Meet __PERFUMEme.py__, ‚Äî a Python package that helps demystify the chemistry behind your scent. Simply input a molecule, and the tool will tell you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whether the molecule is fragrant or toxic\n",
    "- Its key physical properties, such as boiling point\n",
    "- How it evaporates over time, via an evaporation model\n",
    "- And best of all, which perfumes (when data allows) contain that exact molecule\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlock the secrets behind the scents ‚Äî one molecule at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main chemistry involved is organic chemistry and physical chemistry, particularly focusing on volatility and evaporation.\n"

    "## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The __PERFUMEme__ project is a Python-based toolkit designed to bridge the gap between perfumery and cheminformatics by enabling structured, molecule-level exploration of commercial fragrances. Its primary function is to understand if a certain molecule is usable in the perfume industry and understand why or why not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfumes are typically described by their olfactory notes (e.g., floral, woody, spicy) and ingredient names, but rarely include explicit chemical representations. This lack of molecular data limits the potential for computational analysis and machine learning applications in fragrance design. PERFUMEme addresses this issue by enabling users to convert perfume data‚Äîincluding name, brand, ingredient names, and scent notes‚Äîinto a format enriched with chemical identifiers, suitable for further computational analysis, clustering, or visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The package processes structured JSON input and performs the following key tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Queries PubChem using molecule names to retrieve SMILES strings\n",
    "- Handles ambiguous or unrecognized molecule names with graceful fallbacks.\n",
    "- Returns structured data that can be visualized and analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining publicly available molecular data with perfume metadata, PERFUMEme provides a foundation for exploring relationships between molecular composition and fragrance perception, opening the door to computational fragrance classification, similarity scoring, and even automated formulation tools. The typical user of this package would be fragrance chemists, cosmetic scientists, cheminformatics researchers, or curious enthusiasts with a background in organic or physical chemistry ‚Äî especially those interested in functional groups and molecular volatility. \n",

The PubChem PUG REST API was used to access compound properties, such as their molecular names, SMILES strings, boiling point, enthalpy of vaporisation and pressure value.\n",

    "The __PERFUMEme__ package was implemented in Python and organized into several functional modules:\n",

    "- scraper.py: includes functions used to add the molecules listed in the perfumes in perfume.json to a new database and on to addtheir smiles from PubChem, used withodors.csv to add their respective odors (if they had smell).\n",

    "- data/: directory containing the JSON files with structured perfume and molecular data.\n",

    "The package was developed to be modular, allowing users to integrate new data sources or extend the current capabilities without modifying core functions. For example, adding a molecule with its odor and SMILES to molecules.json."

Unlike other databases where the structure and presentation of information are consistent across all records, PubChem's molecule pages vary significantly depending on the compound. This inconsistency posed a problem when attempting to extract specific information, as the function needed to adapt to different page layouts and data formats. After numerous attempts with a variety of molecules, each displaying its data in unique ways, it became evident that a more flexible approach was necessary. Consequently, the function was restructured to handle these discrepancies, incorporating logic to process the different ways in which PubChem presents its information. This modification allowed the function to accept all possible formats and return the correct data, regardless of the molecule's page structure."

As a result, the early version of the function automatically excluded any compound that was either odorless or flagged as potentially toxic. However, this approach proved to be too restrictive. In practice, the fragrance industry sometimes incorporates molecules that serve functional or technical roles‚Äîsuch as fixatives, stabilizers, or solvents‚Äîeven if they don't contribute directly to the scent profile or have some level of toxicity under specific conditions. Recognizing this, the logic of the function was revised to allow for a more flexible and realistic evaluation, acknowledging that the presence of an odor or complete safety is not always a prerequisite for a molecule's use in a perfume formulation. Indeed, for certain molecules, if they are diluted enough, they don't have the same same safety restrictions."

The function __match_mol_to_odor__ only returns the odors of a molecule if it's in the database __molecules.json__. It is definetly possible to allow the user to add the molecule they insert to the database, if it's not yet present. This is an update that can be done in the future. However, __molecules.json__ contains all the molecule from __perfumes.json__, so if a user inputs a molecule which isn't in __molecules.json__ and so adds it to the databse, it won't be detected in a perfume."

By integrating data from PubChem and applying criteria such as odor presence, dermal toxicity, and volatility, the package enables preliminary classification of molecules into fragrance note types (top, heart, or base). It also supports visual exploration through evaporation curves and simplifies molecular data extraction for further analysis. Furthermore, it presents, for a limited amount of perfumes, in which ones a molecule is used and its specified odor.\n",

    "Throughout its development, key challenges such as inconsistent data structures on PubChem and rigid initial assumptions about odor and safety were successfully addressed through flexible code design and exception handling strategies. While the tool presents a valuable foundation for molecule screening and educational purposes, it is important to acknowledge its limitations‚Äîparticularly the reliance on third-party data, simplified volatility modeling, the lack of mixture analysis, and the restrictions in the small database of perfumes.\n",
